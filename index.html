    <h3>Bootcamp project 2021: Simple breakout game</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of procedures in Java. I created a breakout game which uses nested loops and classes. 
        Moreover, the bricks are designed with a brick class, row and column are arranged with a 2-dimensional array. Every element
        shown in the game is presented in a different colour, to showcase the use of colours in Processing. 
        The paddle which is used in the game, represents an ellipse and likewise does the match ball embody the before-mentioned figure. The collision between 
        paddle and ball was coded with the dist() function in addition to x and y vectors. Finally, the game ends, if the ball reaches the bottom of the canvas(height - radiusofBall).

    <h3>Java project 2022: 2D Game,  Icy Guy</h3>
    <p>
	My Java project for the spring term 2022 is a 2D platformer called "icy guy". Icy guy is able to run, jump, crouch, and use certain items within the game. The game contains enemys that have a mind of their own, collectibles such as coins or health collectibles that increase the health of the character. Moreover, there are platforms with certain properties. The properties include reduction of health, increasing of the health, and making the character walk at a slower pace as he steps on the sand platform. The objective of the levels are to defeat a certain amount of enemys while collecting an acceptable amount of coins and to lastly defeat the boss of the final level.
    My Java project included assignments and developing a deep knowledge of object oriented programming principles such as inheritance and encapsulation.
